```
#!/bin/bash
# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e

# NOTE: This script is intended to be run as EC2 User Data, which executes as the 'root' user.
# Therefore, 'sudo' is not strictly necessary for the commands below, but it's kept for clarity
# and so the script can be easily adapted to run in other environments.

cd /root/

# 1. Update package lists and install dependencies
# Combined update, upgrade, and installation of all necessary packages in one go.
# Added 'git' which was missing.
apt-get update -y
apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release git

# 2. Add Docker's official GPG key and set up the repository
# This part is mostly unchanged but ensures directories exist before use.
install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# 3. Install Docker Engine
# Update package list again to include the new Docker repo, then install.
apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# The Docker service is automatically started and enabled on install with modern packages,
# but we can be explicit just in case.
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker

# 4. Clone the Application Repository
# Clones the project into the root user's home directory (/root/)

git clone https://github.com/andresmg42/MLTradingApi.git

cd MLTradingApi/trainapi

# Build and run the containers.
# NOTE: Using 'docker compose' (with a space) which is the command for the v2 plugin.
# The '-d' flag is CRITICAL to run the containers in detached (background) mode,
# allowing the startup script to complete.
# The 'usermod' command has been removed as it is ineffective and unnecessary here.
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```
  - select **Launch instance**

```
cd  MLTradingApi/inferenceapi
```
  - select **Launch instance**}

### 6. Create an EC2 instance to client
steps:
  - go to EC2 amazon service

  - in Private key file format choose **RSA**
  - in Private key file format choose **.pem**
  - select Create key pair, and save in a secure place the key.pem downloaded to access to EC2 instance through the .pem key via ssh
  - in Network settings section select **edit**
  - VPC - required select the previus vpc created **(ml-api-vpc)**
  - in Subnet select the previus public subnet created into ml-api-vpc **(ml-api-subnet-public-1-us-east-1a)**
  - in Auto-assign public IP select **Disable**
  - in Firewall (security groups) select **Select existing security group**
  - in Common security groups select ***client-sec-group**
  - in Configure storage leave by default
  - in Advanced details section down to User **data - optional** section and in the tex box upload the build.sh file of inferenceapi directory from this proyect or copy and paste the previus bash code in the launch of trainapi EC2 instance but change this next two lines which are located almost at the end of the bash code to:
```
cd MLTradingApi/client-plot
```
  - select **Launch instance**

### 7. Browse to Client Interface to prove the MLTradingApi

steps:
  - go to EC2 AWS service
  - in the EC2 dashboard select instances
  - in the instances list deployed, select client
  - in **Details** section look for **Public DNS** or **Public IPv4 address**
  - copy and paste whatever previus address you want in a browser
  - Into API deployed you will see a simple form to train the model
  - in the first input choose a index of those available
  - choose a start date and end date to train the model
  - then, click in **Train Model**
  - wait a moment while the train is executed, for S&P500 it can take at least two minuts
  - then selet the ticker which you want to make the inference in the new form
  - again choose the start and end dates to make the inference
  - click in **Made Inference**, this also take any minuts
  - finally click in the new button called **Generate Gr√°phic**, this will show a graphic from the inference
  - to make a new train, only close the graphic and select **New Train** at the top of the form.
